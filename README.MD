3. Edit settings.js (or leave it as it is)
    - if first word of message matches command words â€“ it will be executed.
    - workChatName is a display name of supergroup or channel you will use to broadcast messages. You need to create a channel or a group (and upgrade it to supergroup) and set it unique display name among your chats.
    - delays between message sending are nessesary to limit api calls per second.
    - checkMessages delay is how often bot will check your workChat for new messages.

### Usage

1. When bot is running, forward (or write) messages to your channel or supergroup.
2. Write a command. For example: ``$ test``
3. In standart settings.json ``$`` means ``forward``, so all messages (except commands) will be sent to all members of group that has an alias ``test``.
